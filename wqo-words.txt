p1: and was successfully->which has been successfully
p3: on can
p4: relation prove
p5: we can be a bit more precise for the definition of antichain branch: \forall w\in B, \exists v such that wv\in L\setminus B
p5: the word a -> the word a^k
p6: consider w to be a maximal element
p6: to be defined: max order type, height, width
p7: yield o -> yield
p10: maybe a non-example of Cor 17, where the downet of a chain is not wqo

Questions/remarks:
	1) Does Cor17 hold for amalgamation systems
	2) What about languages which are downward closed and wqos (for the infix)? are they necessarily of the shape of Cor 14?
	3) It is cool, but i think not an easy sell !


rdv 29/08;

	a*b* is not a chain !

	1): Yes! even for bounded languages
	2): ???
	3): 2 possible directions:
talk about graph embeddings + representing orders by languages(/w infix order)
	4) what about lex order ?


work aliaume:

    2) Let $F \defined \setof{ a b^n a, b a^n b }{n \in \Nat}$. Then $L =
    \Sigma^* \setminus \upset{F}$ is a wqo for the infix order. In fact $L =
    \setof{ \varepsilon, a^n, b^n, a^n b^k, b^n a^k }{n,k \in \Nat}$. However,
    the language $L$ is not defined by finitely many forbidden infixes. This is
    a counterexample to the conjecture that every wqo language for the infix
    order is defined by finitely many forbidden infixes. However, this language
    remains *regular*, and is also of the correct form (Corollary 14).
    
    4) It looks like a language L over {a,b} is wqo for lex-order iff it is included in the
       language a^{<= k_1} b* a^{<= k_2} b* ... 
       where (k_i) is a sequence of positive integers.

	2) remark: downclosed + bounded => regular. Even stronger than that: finite union of languages of the shape u_0*a_1u_1*...a_nu_n* (lets call this a Σ1 language)
	then: bounded <=> included in a Σ1 language <=> downclosure is Σ1
	  Question: does downclosed + wqo => bounded ?
