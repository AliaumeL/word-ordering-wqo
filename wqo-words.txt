p1: and was successfully->which has been successfully
p3: on can
p4: relation prove
p5: we can be a bit more precise for the definition of antichain branch: \forall w\in B, \exists v such that wv\in L\setminus B
p5: the word a -> the word a^k
p6: consider w to be a maximal element
p6: to be defined: max order type, height, width
p7: yield o -> yield
p10: maybe a non-example of Cor 17, where the downet of a chain is not wqo

Questions/remarks:
	1) Does Cor17 hold for amalgamation systems
	2) What about languages which are downward closed and wqos (for the infix)? are they necessarily of the shape of Cor 14?
	3) It is cool, but i think not an easy sell !


rdv 29/08;

	a*b* is not a chain !

	1): Yes! even for bounded languages
	2): ???
	3): 2 possible directions:
talk about graph embeddings + representing orders by languages(/w infix order)
	4) what about lex order ?
