abstract: |
  The set of finite words over a well-quasi-ordered set
  is itself well-quasi-ordered. This seminal result by
  Higman is a cornerstone of the theory of well-quasi-orderings
  and has found numerous applications in computer science. However,
  this result is based on a specific choice of ordering on words,
  the (scattered) subword ordering. In this paper, we describe to what
  extent other natural orderings (prefix, suffix, and infix)
  on words can be used to derive Higman-like theorems.
  More specifically, we are interested in characterizing
  *languages* of words that are well-quasi-ordered under
  these orderings, and explore their properties and connections
  with other language theoretic notions. We furthermore give decision
  procedures when the languages are given by various computational 
  models such as automata, context-free grammars, and
  automatic structures.
