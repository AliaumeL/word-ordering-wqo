abstract: |
  The set of finite words over a well-quasi-ordered set
  is itself well-quasi-ordered. This seminal result by
  Higman is a cornerstone of the theory of well-quasi-orderings
  and has found numerous applications in computer science. However,
  this result is based on a specific choice of ordering on words,
  the (scattered) subword ordering. In this paper, to what 
  extent other natural orderings (prefix, suffix, infix)
  on words can be used to derive Higman-like theorems. 
  More specifically, we are interested in characterizing
  *languages* of words that are well-quasi-ordered under
  these orderings. We show that a simple characterization
  is possible for the prefix and suffix orderings,
  and that under extra regularity assumptions, this also
  lifts to the infix ordering.
