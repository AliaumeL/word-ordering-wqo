abstract: |
  The set of finite words over a well-quasi-ordered set
  is itself well-quasi-ordered. This seminal result by
  Higman is a cornerstone of the theory of well-quasi-orderings
  and has found numerous applications in computer science. However,
  this result is based on a specific choice of ordering on words,
  the (scattered) subword ordering. In this paper, we describe to what 
  extent other natural orderings (prefix, suffix, and infix)
  on words can be used to derive Higman-like theorems. 
  More specifically, we are interested in characterizing
  *languages* of words that are well-quasi-ordered under
  these orderings. We show that a simple characterization
  is possible for the prefix and suffix orderings,
  and that under extra regularity assumptions, this also
  extends to the infix ordering.
