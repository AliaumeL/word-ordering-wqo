We thank the reviewers for their time and their feedback. Of course we aim to remedy all unclear sections. Here we'd 
like to respond to some of the points that have been raised in more detail:

Reviewer 1
----------
- Can you expand a bit on the applications you envision your results can have that cannot be solved with existing tools?
Response: 


Reviewer 2
----------
- You should give a proof for the measures of the languages Lk in the proof of Corollary 14.
Response:

- You could corollary 21 at the end of section 5.1, since its proof call for lemmas 25 and 26. Or move these lemmas to appendix.
Response:

- Part of the claim of Lemma 26 seems redundant with Lemma 24.
Response:

- Unfortunately space is limited, but it would have been nice to have Figures 6 and 7 in the core of the paper.
Response:


Reviewer 3
----------
- Wouldn't it be more concise to characterise (in Thms 8 and 20) 
IDEALS of languages well quasi ordered by the infix ordering, 
instead of the wqo languages themselves?
Response:

- How much the characterisation of Lemma 22 can be generalised
beyond well quasi orders, namely for ideals in the infix order?
Response:

- Why Corollary 34 does not include VASS languages?
Response: 

- There is no a really long and complex proof in the paper, rather a series of
short arguments. As a reader I had an impressions of seeing a series
of small fragmental results, while I'd probably prefer one big result
instead of 20 small ones. 
Response:

- There are numerous forward references (e.g. L.325,425,585,606), please avoid them!
Response:

- The section on prefix/suffix could be probably completely removed from the
paper, with the extra space devoted to the most important arguments that are
now in the appendix.
Response:

- In Sect.6 it would be worth it to explain better how the lemmas 
are used in the proofs of Thms 29,.30.
Response:

- In the appendix, as a good practise it is worth repeating the statements
of the proved theorems/lemmas.
Response:

- L.197-199: unclear what is the tree relation here.
Response: The trees are formed as follows: The root node is the empty sequence, ε. Each node has (potentially infinitely many)
children from the wqoset (X, ≤) such that the sequence of elements from the root to this child satisfy the property expressed
by the tree (i.e., being bad, decreasing or an antichain respectively).

- Thm 8: what are "products"?
Response: By the "product" of two languages L and R we mean the usual pairwise concatenation of words from L and R.

- Lemma 10: what does it mean "simultaneously" here?
Response: By "simulatenously" we mean that we can find a finite set of languages such that their union is P↓(x), and each
language is a chain by the prefix relation, and by the infix relation, and by the suffix relation.

- Lemma 12: what is the meaning of "for arbitrarily large values of n" here?
Response: By "for abritrarily large values of n", we formally mean: ∀k ∃n≥k such that the property holds.

- Lemma 12: point 2 seems to be subsumed by 3, isn't it?

- L.605: what it means "we may fix"?
Response: The concatenative property of amalgamation systems simply requires that each gap word is the concatenation of its 
constituent gap words from the smaller runs, but not in which order. We may pick any gap and pick the ordering in that gap,
but the ordering in the other gaps may then be imposed on us by the structure of the system. For example, when amalgamating
derivation trees of CFGs, each gap has a sibling gap on the intuitive "other side" of the tree that must be concatenated in
the reverse order.

- Lemma 32: "or vice versa" not clear.
Response: By "vice versa" we mean that either G_f ≤ G_g or G_g ≤ G_f
