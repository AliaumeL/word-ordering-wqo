\section{Prefixes and Suffixes}
\label{prefixes-suffixes:sec}

In this section, we study the well-quasi-ordering of languages under the prefix
relation. Let us first remark that the case of the suffix relation is
completely symmetric, and therefore that all our results will apply to the
suffix relation as well.


\begin{itemize}
    \item examples: $a^n$, $ab^n$, $b^na$. 
    \item the tree of prefixes and existence antichains
    \item decision procedure for regular languages
\end{itemize}
