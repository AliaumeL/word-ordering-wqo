\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction:sec}

A \intro{well-quasi-ordered} set is a set $X$ equipped with a quasi-order
$\preceq$ such that every infinite sequence $\seqof{x_n}$ of elements taken in
$X$ contains a pair $x_i \preceq x_j$ with $i < j$. Well-quasi-orderings serve
as a core combinatorial tool powering many termination arguments, and was
successfully applied to the verification of infinite state transition systems
\cite{ABDU96,ABDU98}. One of the appealing properties of well-quasi-orderings
is that they are closed under many operations, such as taking products, finite
unions, and finite powersets \cite{SCSC12}. Perhaps more surprisingly, the
class of well-quasi-ordered sets is also stable under the operation of taking
finite words and finite trees labelled by elements of a well-quasi-ordered set
\cite{HIG52,KRU72}.

\AP Note that in the case of finite words and finite trees, the precise choice
of ordering is crucial to ensure that the resulting structure is
\kl{well-quasi-ordered}. The celebrated result of Higman states that the set of
finite words over an ordered alphabet $(X, \preceq)$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
by the so-called \kl{subword embedding relation} \cite{HIG52}. Let us recall
that the \kl{subword relation} for words over $(X, \preceq)$ is defined as
follows: a word $u$ is a \intro{subword} of a word $v$, written $u
\intro*\higleq v$, if there exists an increasing function $f \colon \{1,
\ldots, |u|\} \to \{1, \ldots, |v|\}$ such that $u_i \preceq v_{f(i)}$ for all
$i \in \{1, \ldots, |u|\}$.

\AP However, there are many other natural orderings on words that could be
considered in the context of \kl{well-quasi-orderings}. Let us restrict
ourselves to a simplified case where the alphabet is finite and equipped with
the equality relation. In this setting, the three alternatives we consider are
the \intro{prefix relation} ($u \intro*\prefleq v$ if there exists $w$ with $uw
= v$), the \intro{suffix relation} ($u \intro*\suffleq v$ if there exists $w$
such that $wu = v$), and the \intro{infix relation} ($u \intro*\infleq v$ if
there exists $w_1,w_2$ such that $w_1 u w_2 = v$). Note that these three
relations straightforwardly generalize to infinite quasi-ordered alphabets.
Unfortunately, it is easy to see that all of these constructions are not
well-quasi-ordered as soon as the alphabet contains two non-equivalent letters:
for instance, the infinite sequence $a^n b^n a^n$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by
the \kl{subword relation} but by neither the \kl{prefix relation}, nor the
\kl{suffix relation}, nor the \kl{infix relation}.


\AP While this dooms \kl[well-quasi-ordered]{well-quasi-orderedness} of these relations in the general case, there may be
\emph{subsets} of $\Sigma^*$ which are \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by these
relations. As a simple example, take the case of finite sets of (finite) words
which are all \kl{well-quasi-ordered} regardless of the ordering considered.
This raises the question of characterizing exactly which subsets $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$
are \kl{well-quasi-ordered} with respect to the \kl{prefix relation}
(respectively, the \kl{suffix relation} or the \kl{infix relation}), and
providing suitable decision procedures.



\subparagraph{Contribution} In this paper, we focus on words over a finite
alphabet $\Sigma$, and characterize subsets $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation}, the \kl{suffix relation},
and the \kl{infix relation}. Specifically, for the \kl{prefix relation} and the \kl{suffix relation}, we are able to show the following decomposition into \intro{chains}, that is, totally ordered ascending sequences.

{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation} if and only if it is a finite union of \kl{chains} of the \kl{prefix relation}.
	\item A language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{suffix relation} if and only if it is a finite union of \kl{chains} of the \kl{suffix relation}.
\end{enumerate}
}

Note that \kl{chains} are the simplest possible
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets (they are totally ordered and well-founded) and it
is known that finite unions of \kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered}. As a consequence, the above characterization states
that only the simplest possible \kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation}. Let us furthermore
highlight that this characterization holds without any restriction on the
decidability of the language $L$ itself, but heavily relies on the assumption
that $\Sigma$ is finite. 

\AP One way to measure the complexity of a \kl{well-quasi-ordered} set is to
consider its so-called \intro{ordinal invariants}. Several of these ordinal
measures have been developed for well-quasi-orders. The \intro{maximal order
type} (or m.o.t.) was originally defined by \cite{dejongh77} as the order type
of the maximal linearization of a well-quasi-ordered set. Then,
\cite{schmidt81} introduced the \intro{ordinal height} as the order type of a
maximal chain of a well-quasi-ordered set. Finally, \cite{kriz90b} crafted the
notion of \intro{ordinal width}, standardized the definitions of these three
\kl{ordinal invariants}, and proved numerical relationships between them. For
the \kl{prefix relation}, the \kl{suffix relation},Â and the \kl{infix
relation}, the \kl{ordinal height} is always bounded by $\omega$, and the key
parameter to describe its complexity will be the \kl{ordinal width}, i.e.,
``how large the antichains are.''

\todo{rephrase}
\AP In the case of the \kl{prefix relation} and the \kl{suffix relation}, we
conclude from our characterization that the \kl{ordinal width} of a language
$L$ is either finite or $L$ is not \kl{well-quasi-ordered}. The straightforward
generalization of the results for the \kl{prefix relation} and the \kl{suffix
relation} to the \kl{infix relation} is not possible. For example, Kuske has
shown that any countable partial order with finite downward closures can be
embedded into it~\cite{DBLP:journals/ita/Kuske06}. In particular, this means
that the \kl{subword relation} can be embedded into the \kl{infix relation}.
The former being a \kl{well-quasi-ordered} with a very large \kl{ordinal width}
(see for example https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14587), this implies that such
"easy characterizations" will not be possible in general. However, not all is
lost: we show that with some mild restrictions we can recover much of the
simple structure of the \kl[prefix relation]{prefix} and \kl{suffix relation}:

{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item A \emph{bounded} language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{infix relation} if and only if it is a finite union of languages $S_i \cdot P_i$, where each $S_i$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{suffix relation} and each $P_i$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation}.
\end{enumerate}
}

We illustrate how this result can be used to study languages recognized by
finite automata, context-free grammars, petri nets, and other systems. This is
possible by leveraging the recently introduced notion of \kl{amalgamation
systems} \cite{ASZZ24}.

{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{2}
	\item A language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ recognized by an \kl{amalgamation system} is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{infix relation} if and only if it is a finite union of languages $S_i \cdot P_i$, where each $S_i$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{suffix relation} and each $P_i$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation}.
\end{enumerate}
}


Finally, there has been recent interest in deciding whether a given order is a
well-quasi-order. These questions have been investigated for example in the
context of the verification of counter
machines~\cite{DBLP:conf/fsttcs/FinkelG19} and in the context of
logic~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/BergstrasserGLZ24}. We conclude our results
with a contribution in this continuity.

\todo{verify this result :)}
{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{3}
	\item For languages of amalgamation systems, it is decidable whether they are \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl[prefix relation]{prefix}, \kl[suffix relation]{suffix}, or \kl{infix relation}.
\end{enumerate}
}

\subparagraph{Related work} The study of alternative \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
relations over finite words is far from new. For instance, orders obtained by
so-called \emph{derivation relations} where already analysed by Bucher,
Ehrenfeucht, and Haussler \cite{BUEUD85}, and were later extended by
D'Alessandro and Varricchio \cite{ALVA03,ALVA06}. However, in all those cases
the orderings are \emph{multiplicative}, that is, if $u_1 \preceq v_1$ and $u_2
\preceq v_2$ then $u_1u_2 \preceq v_1v_2$. This assumption does not hold for
the \kl{prefix}, \kl{suffix}, and \kl{infix} relations.

\subparagraph{Outline} In
\cref{prefixes:sec}, which is relatively
self-contained, we study the \kl{prefix relation} and prove in
\cref{prefixes:thm} the characterization of \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
languages by the \kl{prefix relation}. In
\cref{infixes-regular:sec}, we
obtain the \kl[infix relation]{infix} analogue of \cref{prefixes:thm}
specifically for regular languages
(\cref{infix-finite-automata:thm}). Finally, we generalize this result to all
\kl{amalgamation systems} in \cref{infixes-amalgamation:sec}
in
(\cref{infix-amalgamation:thm}).
