\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction:sec}

A \intro{well-quasi-ordered} set is a set $X$ equipped with a quasi-order
$\preceq$ such that every infinite sequence $\seqof{x_n}$ of elements taken in
$X$ contains a pair $x_i \preceq x_j$ with $i < j$. Well-quasi-orderings serve
as a core combinatorial tool powering many termination arguments, and was
successfully applied to the verification of infinite state transition systems
\cite{ABDU96,ABDU98}. One of the appealing properties of well-quasi-orderings
is that they are closed under many operations, such as taking products, finite
unions, and finite powersets \cite{SCSC12}. More surprisingly, the class of
well-quasi-ordered sets is also stable under the operation of taking finite
words and finite trees labelled by elements of a well-quasi-ordered set
\cite{HIG52,KRU72}.

Note that in the case of finite words and finite trees, the precise choice of
ordering on words and trees is crucial to ensure that the resulting structure
is \kl{well-quasi-ordered}. The celebrated result of Higman states that the set
of finite words over an ordered alphabet $(X, \preceq)$ is
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the so-called \kl{subword embedding relation}
\cite{HIG52}. Let us recall that the \kl{subword relation} for words over $(X,
\preceq)$ is defined as follows: a word $u$ is a \intro{subword} of a word $v$,
written $u \intro*\higleq v$,
if there exists an increasing function $f \colon \{1, \ldots, |u|\} \to \{1,
\ldots, |v|\}$ such that $u_i \preceq v_{f(i)}$ for all $i \in \{1, \ldots,
|u|\}$.

However, there are many other natural orderings on words that could be
considered in the context of \kl{well-quasi-orderings}. In our, case we
consider alphabets $\Sigma$ that are finite and equipped with the equality
relation. In this setting, the three alternatives we consider are the
\intro{prefix relation} --- $u \intro*\prefleq v$ if there exists $w$ with $uw
= v$ ---, the \intro{suffix relation} --- $u \intro*\suffleq v$ if there exists
$w$ such that $wu = v$ ---, and the \intro{infix relation} --- $u
\intro*\infleq v$ if there exists $w_1,w_2$ such that $w_1 u w_2 = v$ ---.
Unfortunately, it is an easy check that all of these constructions are not
well-quasi-ordered as soon as the alphabet contains two non-equivalent letters.
This is not the end of the road, because some \emph{subsets} of $\Sigma^*$
might still be \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by these relations, the simplest example
being the case of finite sets of (finite) words which are all
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} regardless of the ordering considered. This raises the
question of characterizing the subsets $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} with respect to the \kl{prefix relation} (respectively,
the \kl{suffix relation} or the \kl{infix relation}), and providing suitable
decision procedures.


\subparagraph{Contribution} In this paper, we focus on words over a finite
alphabet $\Sigma$, and characterize subsets $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation}, the \kl{suffix relation},
and the \kl{infix relation}. Let us remark that these word orderings are all
\intro{well-founded}, i.e., they do not contain infinite \intro{decreasing
sequences} $\seqof{x_n}$ such that $x_{n+1} \prec x_n$ for all $n \in \Nat$.
Let us recall that the key difference between \kl{well-quasi-orderings} and the
more usual notion of well-founded orderings is that the latter allows the
existence of infinite \intro{antichains}, that is, sets of pairwise
incomparable elements. In fact, a set $X$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} if and
only if it is \kl{well-founded} and does not contain an infinite \kl{antichain}
\cite{KRU72}.  As a consequence, our study focuses on detecting infinite
\kl{antichains} in languages $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$.

In the case of the \kl{prefix relation}, we provide a complete characterization
of languages $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that are \kl{well-quasi-ordered}, which are
the simplest possible languages: they are precisely the \emph{finite} unions of
\intro{chains}, that is, sets of words that are all comparable for the
\kl{prefix relation}. Note that \kl{chains} are the simplest possible
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets (they are totally ordered and well-founded) and it
is known that finite unions of \kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered}. As a consequence, the above characterization states
that only the simplest possible \kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation}. Let us furthermore
highlight that this characterization holds without any restriction on the
decidability of the language $L$ itself, but heavily relies on the assumption
that $\Sigma$ is finite. By symmetry, we obtain an analogue statement for the
\kl{suffix relation}.

In the case of the \kl{infix relation}, the situation is more complex, and we
show that \emph{any} countable quasi-ordering with finite initial segments can
be embedded into the \kl{infix relation} of a language over a binary alphabet
$\Sigma \defined \set{a,b}$. As an example, on can embed $(\Sigma^*, \higleq)$
into $(\Sigma^*, \infleq)$ where $\higleq$ is the \kl{subword relation} and
$\infleq$ is the \kl{infix relation}. This strongly contrasts with the
\kl{prefix relation}, and suggests that a meaningful characterization of
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} languages under the \kl{infix relation} is unlikely to
be found. 

We circumvent this issue by adding some regularity assumptions on the languages
$L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that we consider. This can be done by assuming that $L$
is recognized by a finite automaton, or more generally that $L$ is the language
of an \kl{amalgamation system}. Under these relatively mild assumptions, we
also prove that \kl{well-quasi-ordered} languages under the \kl{infix relation}
are precisely the finite unions of \kl{chains}.

\subparagraph{Related work} The study of alternative \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
relations over finite words is far from new. For instance, orders obtained by
so-called \emph{derivation relations} where already analysed by Bucher,
Ehrenfeucht, and Haussler \cite{BUEUD85}. These results were later extended by
D'Alessandro and Varricchio \cite{ALVA03,ALVA06}. However, in all those cases
the orderings are \emph{multiplicative}, that is, if $u_1 \preceq v_1$ and $u_2
\preceq v_2$ then $u_1u_2 \preceq v_1v_2$. This assumption does not hold for
the \kl{prefix}, \kl{suffix}, and \kl{infix} relations.

\subparagraph{Outline} In \cref{prefixes:sec}, which is relatively
self-contained, we study the \kl{prefix relation} prove in \cref{prefixes:thm}
the characterization of \kl{well-quasi-ordered} languages by the \kl{prefix
relation}. In \cref{infixes-regular:sec}, we prove that any countable quasi-ordering
with finite initial segments can be embedded into the \kl{infix relation} of a
language (\cref{infix-embedding:thm}), we obtain the analogue of
\cref{prefixes:thm} for languages recognized by finite automata
(\cref{infix-finite-automata:thm}). Finally, in \cref{infixes-amalgamation:sec}, we
introduce \kl{amalgamation systems} and generalize
\cref{infix-finite-automata:thm} to this setting
(\cref{infix-amalgamation:thm}).
