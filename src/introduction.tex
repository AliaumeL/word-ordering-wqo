\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction:sec}

\AP A \intro{well-quasi-ordered} set is a set $X$ equipped with a quasi-order
$\preceq$ such that every infinite sequence $\seqof{x_n}$ of elements taken in
$X$ contains a pair $x_i \preceq x_j$ with $i < j$. Well-quasi-orderings serve
as a core combinatorial tool powering many termination arguments, and was
successfully applied to the verification of infinite state transition
systems~\cite{ABDU96,ABDU98}. One of the appealing properties of
well-quasi-orderings is that they are closed under many operations, such as
taking products, finite unions, and finite powerset
constructions~\cite{SCSC12}. Perhaps more surprisingly, the class of
well-quasi-ordered sets is also stable under the operation of taking finite
words and finite trees labelled by elements of a well-quasi-ordered set
\cite{HIG52,KRU72}.

\AP Note that in the case of finite words and finite trees, the precise choice
of ordering is crucial to ensure that the resulting structure is
\kl{well-quasi-ordered}. The celebrated result of Higman states that the set of
finite words over an ordered alphabet $(X, \preceq)$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
by the so-called \kl{subword embedding relation}~\cite{HIG52}. Let us recall
that the \kl{subword relation} for words over $(X, \preceq)$ is defined as
follows: a word $u$ is a \intro{subword} of a word $v$, written $u
\intro*\higleq v$, if there exists an increasing function $f \colon \{1,
\ldots, |u|\} \to \{1, \ldots, |v|\}$ such that $u_i \preceq v_{f(i)}$ for all
$i \in \{1, \ldots, |u|\}$.

\AP However, there are many other natural orderings on words that could be
considered in the context of \kl{well-quasi-orderings}, even in the simplified
setting of a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ equipped with the equality relation. In
this setting, the three alternatives we consider are the \intro{prefix
relation} ($u \intro*\prefleq v$ if there exists $w$ with $uw = v$), the
\intro{suffix relation} ($u \intro*\suffleq v$ if there exists $w$ such that
$wu = v$), and the \intro{infix relation} ($u \intro*\infleq v$ if there exists
$w_1,w_2$ such that $w_1 u w_2 = v$). Note that these three relations
straightforwardly generalize to infinite quasi-ordered alphabets.
Unfortunately, it is easy to see that all of these constructions are not
well-quasi-ordered as soon as the alphabet contains two distinct letters:
for instance, the infinite sequence $a^n b^n a^n$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by
the \kl{subword relation} but by neither the \kl{prefix relation}, nor the
\kl{suffix relation}, nor the \kl{infix relation}.

\AP While this dooms \kl[well-quasi-ordered]{well-quasi-orderedness} of these
relations in the general case, there may be \emph{subsets} of $\Sigma^*$ which
are \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by these relations. As a simple example, take the
case of finite sets of (finite) words which are all \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
regardless of the ordering considered. This raises the question of
characterizing exactly which subsets $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} with respect to the \kl{prefix relation} (respectively,
the \kl{suffix relation} or the \kl{infix relation}), and together with
suitable decision procedures.

\AP Let us argue that this question is not only of theoretical interest.
Indeed, there has been recent breakthroughs in deciding whether a given order
is a \kl{well-quasi-order}, for instance in the context of the verification of
infinite state transition systems~\cite{DBLP:conf/fsttcs/FinkelG19} or in the
context of logic~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/BergstrasserGLZ24}. Our decision
procedures clearly contribute to this line of research in the context of words.
Furthermore, a previous work by Kuske shows that any
\emph{reasonable}\footnote{ This will be made precise in
\cref{infix-embedding:thm}. } partially ordered set $(X, \leq)$ can
be embedded into $\set{a,b}^*$ with the \kl{infix relation}~\cite[Lemma
5.1]{DBLP:journals/ita/Kuske06}. Phrased differently, one can encode a large
class of partially ordered sets as subsets of $\set{a,b}^*$. As a consequence,
the following decision problem provides a reasonable abstract framework for
deciding whether a given partially ordered set is \kl{well-quasi-ordered}:
given a language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$, decide whether $L$ is
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{suffix relation}, or the \kl{infix
relation}.

\AP When considering an algorithm based on a \kl{well-quasi-ordering}, the
runtime of the algorithm is deeply related to the ``complexity'' of the
underlying quasi-order~\cite{SCHMITZ17}. One way to measure this complexity is
to consider its so-called \kl{ordinal invariants}: for instance, the
\kl{maximal order type} (or m.o.t.), originally defined by De Jongh and Parikh
\cite{dejongh77}, is the order type of the maximal linearization of a
well-quasi-ordered set. In the case of a finite set, the m.o.t. is precisely
the size of the set. Better runtime bounds were obtained by considering two
other parameters~\cite{SCHMITZ19}: the \kl{ordinal height} introduced by
Schmidt \cite{schmidt81}, and the \kl{ordinal width} of Kříž and Thomas
\cite{kriz90b}. Therefore, when characterizing \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
languages, we will also be interested in computing bounds on their \kl{ordinal
invariants}. We refer to \cref{ordinal-invariants:subsec}
for a more detailed introduction to these
parameters and ordinal computations in general.

\subparagraph{Contribution} In this paper, we focus on words over a finite
alphabet $\Sigma$, and characterize subsets $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that are
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation}, the \kl{suffix relation},
and the \kl{infix relation}. Furthermore, we devise decision algorithms
whenever the languages are given by reasonable computational models. Finally,
we provide relatively low bounds on the possible \kl{ordinal invariants} of
such languages.

Specifically, for the \kl{prefix relation} and the
\kl{suffix relation}, we are able to show the following decomposition into
\intro{chains}, that is, totally ordered ascending sequences.

{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation} if and only if it is a finite union of \kl{chains} of the \kl{prefix relation}.
    \hfill (\cref{prefixes:thm} p.\pageref{prefixes:thm})
	\item A language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{suffix relation} if and only if it is a finite union of \kl{chains} of the \kl{suffix relation}.
    \hfill (\cref{prefixes:thm} p.\pageref{prefixes:thm})
\end{enumerate}
}

Note that \kl{chains} are the simplest possible \kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets
(they are totally ordered and well-founded) and it is known that finite unions
of \kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets are \kl{well-quasi-ordered}. As a consequence,
the above characterization states that only the simplest possible
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} sets are \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix
relation}. Let us furthermore highlight that this characterization holds
without any restriction on the decidability of the language $L$ itself, but
heavily relies on the assumption that $\Sigma$ is finite. This allows us to
derive the following bounds on the \kl{ordinal invariants} of such
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} languages, which can be interpreted in two dual ways:
first, these languages are extremely simple, which means that one could have
hoped for using directly another well-quasi-ordered set without resorting to
finite words; second, any time one encounters a \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
language, it is going to provide relatively efficient algorithms.
{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item All languages $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ are 
        \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation} 
        (resp. \kl{suffix relation}) have an \kl{ordinal height} of at most $\omega$,
        a finite \kl{ordinal width}, and a \kl{maximal order type} strictly
        below $\omega^2$.
        \hfill (\cref{prefixes-ordinal-invariants:cor} p.\pageref{prefixes-ordinal-invariants:cor})
\end{enumerate}
}



\AP The straightforward generalization of the results for the \kl{prefix
relation} and the \kl{suffix relation} to the \kl{infix relation} is not
possible. Indeed, it follows from Kuske's result that $\Sigma^*$ equipped with
the \kl{subword relation} can be embedded into $\set{a,b}^*$ with the \kl{infix
relation}~\cite[Lemma 5.1]{DBLP:journals/ita/Kuske06}. This implies that there
are \kl{well-quasi-ordered} languages for the \kl{infix relation} that have
very large \kl{ordinal invariants}: for instance, the \kl{maximal order type}
of the \kl{subword relation} is $\omega^{\omega^{\card{\Sigma} - 1}}$, which
equals its \kl{ordinal width} \cite[Corollary 3.9, Theorem 4.21]{DZSCSC20}.
However, not all is lost if we restrict ourselves to \kl{bounded languages},
i.e., languages that are included in some $w_1^* \cdots w_k^*$ for some finite
choice of words $w_1, \ldots, w_k$. We are able to show the following:

{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{3}
    \item A \kl{bounded language} $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{infix relation} if and only if it is (included in) a finite union of languages $S_i \cdot P_i$, where each $S_i$ 
        is a \kl{chain} for the \kl{suffix relation},
        and where
        each $P_i$ is a \kl{chain} for the \kl{prefix relation}.

        \hfill
        (\cref{bounded-language:thm} p.\pageref{bounded-language:thm})
\end{enumerate}
}

This result directly translates into upper bounds on the possible \kl{ordinal invariants}
of such languages similarly as for the \kl{prefix relation}. Notice that these
upper bounds are significantly smaller than \kl{ordinal invariants} of the \kl{subword
relation}.
{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item All \kl{bounded languages}
            $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that are \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{infix relation}
            have an \kl{ordinal height} of at most $\omega$,
            an \kl{ordinal width} strictly below $\omega^2$, and
            a \kl{maximal order type} strictly below $\omega^3$.
\end{enumerate}
}

\AP Finally, we provide a decision procedure for checking whether a language is
\kl{well-quasi-ordered}, which takes as inputs languages recognized by
\kl{amalgamation systems} \cite{ASZZ24}. Such systems will be formally
introduced in
\cref{amalgamation-systems:subsec}, but
for the moment let us just say that they include many classical computational
models such as finite automata, context-free grammars, and Petri nets
\cite{ASZZ24}. This provides us with a \emph{meta-algorithm} for deciding
whether a given language is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix
relation}, the \kl{suffix relation}, or the \kl{infix relation} under mild
effective restrictions on the computational model that we call an \kl{effective
amalgamative class}, the formal statement of which we defer to
\cref{infixes-amalgamation-effective:subsec}.

{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{R\arabic{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{5}
    \item 
        Let $L$ be a language recognized by an \kl{amalgamation system}.
        If $L$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{infix relation},
        then $L$ is a \kl{bounded language}.

        \hfill (\cref{infix-amalgamation:thm} p.\pageref{infix-amalgamation:thm})
    \item 
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a \kl{strongly effective amalgamative class} of languages.
        There is a decision procedure that takes as input a language $L \in \mathcal{C}$,
        and decides whether $L$ is \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{prefix relation},
        the \kl{suffix relation}, or the \kl{infix relation}. 
        \hfill (\cref{infix-wqo-is-emptiness:thm} p.\pageref{infix-wqo-is-emptiness:thm})
\end{enumerate}
}
Let us point out that the above result implies that the hypothesis of
\kl{bounded languages} on the theoretical side is not a restriction at all in
practice. As a practical and more easily understandable 
consequence,
our generic decision procedure applies 
to the class $\mathcal{C}_\text{aut}$ of all languages recognized by finite automata,
and to the class $\mathcal{C}_\text{cfg}$ of all languages recognized by context-free grammars,
which are both \kl{effective amalgamative classes}.


\subparagraph{Related work} The study of alternative \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
relations over finite words is far from new. For instance, orders obtained by
so-called \emph{derivation relations} where already analysed by Bucher,
Ehrenfeucht, and Haussler \cite{BUEUD85}, and were later extended by
D'Alessandro and Varricchio \cite{ALVA03,ALVA06}. However, in all those cases
the orderings are \emph{multiplicative}, that is, if $u_1 \preceq v_1$ and $u_2
\preceq v_2$ then $u_1u_2 \preceq v_1v_2$. This assumption does not hold for
the \kl{prefix}, \kl{suffix}, and \kl{infix} relations.

\subparagraph{Outline} 
We introduce in \cref{prelims:sec} the
necessary background on \kl{well-quasi-orders} and \kl{ordinal invariants}.
In
\cref{prefixes:sec}, which is relatively
self-contained, we study the \kl{prefix relation} and prove in
\cref{prefixes:thm} the characterization of \kl{well-quasi-ordered}
languages by the \kl{prefix relation}. In
\cref{infixes-regular:sec}, we
obtain the \kl[infix relation]{infix} analogue of \cref{prefixes:thm}
specifically for \kl{bounded languages}
(\cref{bounded-language:thm}). Finally, 
we generalize this result to all
\kl{amalgamation systems} in \cref{infixes-amalgamation:sec}
in
(\cref{infix-amalgamation:thm}),
and provide a decision procedure for checking whether a language is
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \kl{infix relation} in
this context (\cref{infix-wqo-is-emptiness:thm}).
