\begin{abstract}
    The set of finite words over a well-quasi-ordered set is itself
    well-quasi-ordered. This seminal result by Higman is a cornerstone
    of the theory of well-quasi-orderings and has found numerous
    applications in computer science. However, this result is based on a
    specific choice of ordering on words, the (scattered) subword
    ordering. In this paper, we describe to what extent other natural
    orderings (prefix, suffix, infix) on words can be used to derive
    Higman-like theorems. More specifically, we are interested in
    characterizing \emph{languages} of words that are well-quasi-ordered
    under these orderings. We show that a simple characterization is
    possible for the prefix and suffix orderings, and that under extra
    regularity assumptions, this also lifts to the infix ordering.
